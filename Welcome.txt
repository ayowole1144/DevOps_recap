This is a recap of everything that's been done in the DevOps traing class with Uncle Seun
We are currently on day 14 and I have been opened up to a lot of new things and tools 
devOps engineer use on a day to day base. A few of these tools being: AWS, Jenkins, Ubuntu, github, git, Docker
At the beginning of it we learnt the basic of linux command using Ubuntu, created some shell scripts to 
check the processes running on our machine, worked with more advanced commands like GREP,AWK,and Crontab

On git we first learnt how to clone a repository onto our machine using
git clone "repo url", before this I configured git to match my github account
using the command: git config --global user.name && user.email
after cloning the repo cloud peris I ran the java web application
spring-main-petclinic, which was ran on my local computer
